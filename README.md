| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd982bc0-7256-47ef-8fb1-af7cc9083cd6) | As a founder, I held many positions from start to the end, like: Product Owner, Designer, Video Producer, User Experience Designer, Game Developer, Marketing Manager, Human Resources, Accounting Manager, and the Pitching Guy. |

Under this scope, my team and I launched a mobile game called Milky Shaky LAB: a telescope simulator for space explorers to find celestial bodies in real time, collect scientific stickers, test their knowledge and fill stunning albums, using their mobile devices. It's a kind of Pokémon Go, but Cosmic!

We won 4 Public Notices from the City Hall of São Paulo, which helped playSTEM academy deliver "Milky Shaky LAB", connected with CERN’s and NASA’s teams, and do presentations in Brazil and in a few events in Europe, like: GamesCon (Germany)

- 🪐 I've built and published a real-time astronomical mobile game app for kids called `Milky Shaky LAB`. ⋆｡ﾟ☁︎｡⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡⋆
- 👯 It was done in collaboration with my fellow friends: Marcos Inoue, [Guilherme Sabino](https://github.com/guilmedev), [Lucas Almeida](https://github.com/lucasrdea) >> with a help from [Alfredo Gomes](https://github.com/alfredo1995), [Nikopaah](https://github.com/nikopaah), and [Daniel Portela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-portela-725637b3/)
- 📲 You can download `Milky Shaky LAB`, it's **free** and without ads (remember: it's for kids, therefor -> no ads 🚫 no chat, but a lot of **scientific knowledge**)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due new Google Play Policy Restrictions, Milky Shaky LAB was temporarily removed from the store. It needs to be updated, but I didn't have spare time yet. I hope I'll make it!
